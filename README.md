This is WIP surface shading program that uses the NCCA Graphics Library(NGL) and GLSL.
The aim is to render a PBR shaded model. The boilerplate code is taken from Jon Macey's
SimpleNGL demo.

## To do list
* ~Look into GLSL basics.~
* Import obj model.
* ~Apply Phong shader.~
* ~Figure out texturing.~
* ~Look into Frame buffer object for multipass rendering.~
* Add shadows and environment mapping.
* Add depth of field.

## Stretch goals
* Parallax Mapping for the wholes
