This is WIP surface shading program that uses the NCCA Graphics Library(NGL) and GLSL.
The aim is to render a PBR shaded model. The boilerplate code is taken from Jon Macey's
SimpleNGL demo.

#h2 To do list
* Look into GLSL basics.
* Import obj model.
* Apply Phong shader.
* Figure out texturing.
* Look into Frame buffer object for multipass rendering.
* Add shadows and environment mapping.

#h2 Stretch Goal
* PBR
